Using NAPALM library perform a complete configuration replace operation
on the juniper3 router.

When doing this you should only change the interface IP addresses of the following
interfaces, nothing else.

    ge-0/0/0
    ge-0/0/1
    ge-0/0/2
    ge-0/0/3

Perform a compare_config() operation before performing a commit_config() to ensure 
you are only changing the above interface IPs and nothing else.
